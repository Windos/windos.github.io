I can't tell you how happy I am to be writing this post.

AppId's have been a [thorn in my
side](https://king.geek.nz/2017/10/09/burnttoast-no-appid/) for a long time. I've
been using a loophole to get toasts displayed which recent versions of Windows
10 closed. This resulted in my removing the ability to easily set a custom AppId.

The fix in the short term was to hard code
[BurntToast](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/BurntToast)'s default
AppId to that of powershell.exe. This allowed toasts to be displayed again, but
in the Action Center they would appear greyed outâ€¦ not nice.

That's no longer the case.

### Inspiration

First, I'd like to thank [Adam Driscoll](https://twitter.com/adamdriscoll) for
providing the thread to pull on to solve this issue.

Simple, little installers from <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PowerShell?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#PowerShell</a> <a href="https://t.co/inCCnEukgO">pic.twitter.com/inCCnEukgO</a></p>&mdash; Adam Driscoll (@adamdriscoll) <a href="https://twitter.com/adamdriscoll/status/957059357694414848?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 27, 2018</a></blockquote>

I'd looked into [WiX](http://wixtoolset.org/) in the past. I didn't instantly
get my head around it and moved on. Adam's tweet (and
[answer](https://twitter.com/adamdriscoll/status/957251989259374592) to my AppId
question) prompted me to give it another look.

### BurntToast Installer

Over on [GitHub you'll find an
msi](https://github.com/Windos/BurntToast/releases/tag/v0.0.1) you can use to
"install" a dummy application for BurntToast complete with an AppId laden
shortcut in the start menu.

The installer isn't signed, so you will get a warning when you run it.

It'll put a PNG file into "**C:\\Program Files\\BurntToast\\**" and throw a
shortcut to that file into your start menu.

To actually use it, find the directory where the BurntToast module lives and
open **config.json**. Change the AppId in this file to
"**King.Geek.NZ!BurntToast**"

![Changing config.json](/images/burnttoast-appid-installer/config.png)

If you don't know where the module is installed, run this:

```powershell
Get-Module -Name BurntToast -ListAvailable | Select -Property ModuleBase
```

**Proof Is in the (Bread and Butter) Pudding**

And here's the result:

### Next Steps

The next version of this installer will likely change the configured AppId in
BurntToast automatically. And the next version of BurntToast will include a
better method for updating the default AppId without having to dig up the json
file.

My next blog post will be on how you can use the WiX Toolset to create your own
fully working AppId, for those situations when the name BurntToast isn't
suitable.
