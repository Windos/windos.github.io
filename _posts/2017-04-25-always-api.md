Take this hypothetical, totally-didn’t-recently-come-up-at-work, scenario:
you’re business uses two disparate cloud services and needs them to share data,
but they don’t integrate natively.

You, the scripting magician that you are, can take an export from the first
service, manipulate it however it needs to be manipulated and then import it to
the other service. You could do this in reverse. You could do this all day,
every day.

But you really don’t need to make this harder than it needs to be.
