title: "Crouton #1 - Toast Notifications for New Stack Overflow Questions"
---

Last night I pushed an update for the
[BurntToast](https://github.com/Windos/BurntToast) PowerShell module to the
[PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/BurntToast).
This update, version 0.5.2, exposed the ability to add custom buttons to your
toast notifications instead of just the standard Snooze and Dismiss option from
previous versions.

This dramatically increases the flexibility and usability of these PowerShell
generated toasts.

In an effort to show off the cool things you can accomplish with BurntToast, and
to demo new features as they come out, I’ll be writing a series of ‘Croutons.’

### What the heck is a Crouton?

A crouton is a small piece of toast for soup or salads.

Onto the post!

Seriously though, I have way too much fun naming projects and tools. In the
context of this site a ‘Crouton’ is a (hopefully) short post detailing one use
for the BurntToast module.

Get it? Small piece of (burnt) toast.

### Buttons!
