---

Given it’s the holiday season, I recently spent about 3 hours live streaming the
development of PowerShell based a [Secret
Santa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_Santa) Organizer. You can watch the
videos from these streams, if you’re so inclined, over on
[YouTube](https://youtu.be/Xr5FKSVu-E4).

I can’t live with giving my projects straight forward names; with that in mind
let’s check out
[KovertKringle](https://github.com/Windos/powershell-depot/tree/master/General/KovertKringle).

### Slow down… what’s a Secret Santa?

If you’ve never done it before, Secret Santa basically boils down to a group of
people who are each assigned another member of the group to buy a present for.
One should only know who they’re buying for and not, for example, who is buying
something for them.

This would often be done by drawing names from a hat… but that’s not nearly
geeky enough in 2017, is it?
